## Description

A simple app that demonestrates the powerful of Javascript how the DOM can be manupilated and web pages can be modified. The app has few lines of code for JS and HTML to count the People entering a subway and then save the numbers for later use. This kind of technology can pave a way that a feature project can be initiated to count people or any kind of traffic entering or leaving a certian area by placing a sensing device and using a program like Javascript. Cool Right?! That is why I like JS!
